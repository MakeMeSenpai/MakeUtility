## MakeUtility
This is a terminal based application simply made to help users prevent eye strain. This is based on doctors recommendations of looking away from your screen for 20 seconds at something 20 feet away, after staring at a screen for 20 minutes.

## How to run
### only  works for mac
- git clone this repository!
- Have Golang installed!
- run '$go run main.go'

This should run until you close your computer. In order to cancel prematurely, use cmd+c in your terminal.

#### If you are having issues with silent notifications
You may need to adjust your notification settings. I fixed this problem by
1. right clicking/ two finger clicking the notification.
2. Selected Notification Preferences
3. Set shows previews from "when unlocked" to "always"
Note that you can always simply right click the notification and select Deliver Quietly if it ever gets too annoying.
