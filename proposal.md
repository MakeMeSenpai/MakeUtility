This week I will solve eye strain by sending users a notification to let them know that they have been staring at their computer screen for far too long. 

The MVP will include a print statement that lets users know that they've been looking at their computer for too long, using while loops and go's time library.

Second phase will use a sound indicator so that users don't have to constantly keep checking back on their terminal to know when they should take a break from looking at their screens.
